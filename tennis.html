        <h3>Serena Williams</h3>
        <p>Serena Williams is a revolutionary female tennis player. She has won more Grand Slam singles titles than any other man or woman during the open era. S She grew up in Compton, California
            and she and her sister, Venus, was coached by her father at an early age. She began her debut at 16 in 1998 in the Australian opener. She won her first match, but her sister
            beat her in the second round. This was the match that brought their 'rivalry' to the spotlight. When Serena was 17, she won her first Grand Slam, making her one of the youngest 
            female tennis players to win a Major. She boasts this set of achievements:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>23 Grand Slam titles</li>
            <li>4 Olympic Gold Medals</li>
            <li>14 Grand Slam Doubles titles</li>
            <li>Won the French Open thrice</li>
        </ul>

        <!--this part of the code is about venus williams-->
        <p>Only Margaret Court has won more Grand Slams than her (24). She is planning to retire soon, and many believe this will be an end to an era.</p>
